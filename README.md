# Uber-Trips-Analysis

Analyzing Uber trips can provide valuable insights into ride patterns, helping optimize services 
and improve customer experiences. In this project, we will analyze Uber ride data to detect patterns
and relationships between different variables using Python. We'll perform data exploration, uncover hidden
patterns, and visualize the relationships discovered in the data.
